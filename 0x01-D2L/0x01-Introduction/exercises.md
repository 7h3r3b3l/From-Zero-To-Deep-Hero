# Exercises for the section 0x01-Introduction from d2l.ai



## Which parts of code that you are currently writing could be “learned”, i.e., improved by learning and automatically determining design choices that are made in your code? Does your code include heuristic design choices? What data might you need to learn the desired behavior?

- Sometimes when i'm programming exploits i take too much arbitrary desitions, for example considering the delay that request have to take between them to make the attacks work, or sometimes i dont understand what the scripts make, i think machine learning may be usefull to reverse assm code or quickly find vulnerabilities on DOM pages.

## Which problems that you encounter have many examples for their solution, yet no specific way for automating them? These may be prime candidates for using deep learning.
- All the face recognition systems.

## Describe the relationships between algorithms, data, and computation. How do characteristics of the data and the current available computational resources influence the appropriateness of various algorithms?

1. Computation use algorithms to teach computers how to make different processes, sometimes, those algorithms interact with data that may be collected or used to take further desitions in the algorith behavior

## Name some settings where end-to-end training is not currently the default approach but where it might be useful.
1. Automate a game like Spelunky where the map changes everytime and the strategy for playing it also changes.
2. Recognize pictures with thins on it
3. Recognizing patterns into the armed conflict in Colombia
