#### common application areas
1. making prediction
2. compressing data
3. generating new data
4. learning a series of actions

#### concrete examples
1. spam classification
2. locating cars in a screen
3. extracting digits from screen
4. resampling large quantities of images
5. representing high dimentional dataset into $\mathbb{R}^2$ field 
6. creating new images (this person does not exist), cats, rentals, ... 
7. playing chest, learning games, doing robots..., etc


### Supervised learning
- the labels are used for training the models
-  classifying
- predicting data
### Unsupervised learning
- there are not labels for data
- clustering
- compressing data
### Reinforcement learning
- learning series of actions

---

for generating new data, this can be supervised or unsupervised.
